# src/commands/watch.yaml

description: |
  watch will poll the CircleCI API to determine when the
  build is done. It should be its own job dependent on the job that runs
  start_trace, and no job should depend on it finishing.

parameters:

  timeout:
    description: Timeout after which we consider the build failed, in minutes. Should be at least double your longest expected build.
    type: integer
    default: 20
  
  buildevents-version:
    description: specify the installed buildevents version 
    type: string
    default: ""

steps:
  # - restore_cache:
  #     key: buildevents-v<< parameters.buildevents-version >>{{ .Environment.BUILDEVENTS_CACHE_VERSION }}
  #     paths:
  #       - /tmp
  - run:
      name: watch then finish build trace
      command: |
        source $BASH_ENV
        export BUILDEVENT_TIMEOUT=<< parameters.timeout >>
        buildevents watch $CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID
